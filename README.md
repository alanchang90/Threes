## Introduction：

### This is a project that I had at 2021 spring semester. The goal of this project require student to write a similar game based on a game called "Triples" in the Apple store. So, the first thing I did was design a game board for my game. I add some basic buttons that the users can move the number tile by clicking the button below to play this game. Then the score can change when users get more numbers to add up to a larger number. Then I add a function that allows users to move the number tile by reading the movement from users’ fingers on the screen. That gives the users two options to play this game.

### Now we have completed the basic game interface design and gameplay selection. The next thing I do is to add a record interface to my game that can record the player's score.

### I think the whole process of researching the project has brought me a very good game design experience. First, although I am making a game whose gameplay has been determined. But the interface design and the user's mobile cube gameplay are finished by me. This is my first attempt at designing a game. Throughout the design and programming process, I will stand from the user's perspective and think about how my users feel when playing my game. So I think I have a deeper understanding and knowledge of game design. The most profound feeling that game design brings to me is that when I am a designer, I will learn how to think about problems from the perspective of users.
