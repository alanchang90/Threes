# **Triples Game Clone**

## **Introduction**

This project was completed during the Spring 2021 semester as part of an academic assignment. The objective was to create a game inspired by the popular **"Triples"** game available on the Apple Store. The process involved designing the game board, implementing gameplay mechanics, and enhancing the user experience through intuitive interactions and features.

## **Game Development Process**

### **Game Board Design and Basic Gameplay**
The first step was to design the game board and implement basic gameplay functionalities. I created an interactive board with buttons that allow users to move number tiles. Players can combine numbers to form larger values, and the score dynamically updates as the game progresses.  

To enhance the gaming experience, I introduced two gameplay options:
1. **Button Controls**: Users can move the tiles by clicking on directional buttons.
2. **Touch Gestures**: Users can also move tiles by swiping their fingers on the screen, providing a more natural and immersive interaction.

### **Score Recording Feature**
To further enhance the game, I added a **score recording interface**. This feature allows players to keep track of their scores after each game session, creating a sense of achievement and competition.

## **Reflections on the Project**

Developing this game provided me with invaluable experience in **game design** and **user-centered development**. While the gameplay mechanics were predetermined, I was responsible for designing the interface and implementing user interactions, such as touch-based controls.  

This project was my first attempt at designing and programming a game, and it taught me how to approach problems from the userâ€™s perspective. I constantly considered how users would interact with the game and how to make their experience enjoyable and intuitive.  

### **Key Takeaways**
- Improved understanding of game design principles and user experience.
- Gained hands-on experience in designing interfaces and implementing intuitive controls.
- Learned to think critically and creatively about user needs, ensuring the design aligns with their expectations.

The process of creating this game deepened my appreciation for the importance of **user-centric design** in software development, particularly in game design.

## **Conclusion**

This project was not only an academic assignment but also a foundational experience that introduced me to the world of game design. It reinforced the importance of considering user perspectives, which I continue to apply in all my software development projects.
